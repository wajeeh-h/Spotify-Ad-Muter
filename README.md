# Spotify-Ad-Muter
An AutoHotkey script that mutes Spotify when an ad begins playing.

# Requirements
- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

# Installation
- Download and run `muter.ahk`

# Usage
- The script will continue running in the background regardless of if Spotify is opened- it uses very little system resources. When an advertisement begins playing, the process will be muted until it's finished.
